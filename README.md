The Mancala game is a 2-player strategy board game that is played with small stones & pits and rows of pits. Versions of the game date back to the 7th century and it is one of the oldest games that is still played today. Here, I'll recreate the game.


## Setup & Rules

1. 2 players would sit on opposite sides with a bin to the right designated to be the player's home bin. In addition to the home bin, each player would have 6 pits that are initially filled with 2/3/4/5/6 stones.   
2. For each turn, the player can choose one of the pits and remove all stones in that pit by placing a stone counterclockwise around the board in each pit including the player's home bin but not the opponent's home bin. 
3. The game ends when all stones end up in the homebins and the player with more stones wins. 
4.
